    <big><b>Why its important to track air and soil temp and soil moisture for
    predicting crop calendar schedules?</big></b>
   <br> 
    <br />1. Plant physiology: The temperature of the soil and air affects the
    physiological processes of plants, such as photosynthesis and respiration.
    Low soil temperature can impair root growth and resource uptake, leading to
    a mismatch between the physiological activity of aboveground and belowground
    organs. Additionally, high soil temperatures can negatively impact plant
    metabolism, causing reductions in root growth and decreased root
    water/nutrient uptake.

    2. Water and nutrient absorption: Soil moisture content plays a
    crucial role in the absorption of water and nutrients by plants.
    Insufficient soil moisture can limit the substrate supply to soil, affecting
    the utilization of added organic carbon by microbes. Excessive soil
    moisture can lead to a lower biomass of microorganisms due to the formation
    of oxygen conditions that are unfavorable to aerobic bacteria and
    mycorrhizal fungi.

    3. Photosynthesis and respiration: Soil temperature
    affects the rate of photosynthesis and respiration in plants. High soil
    temperatures can accelerate germination, but may not be favorable for growth
    and development throughout the entire plant life cycle. Low soil
    temperatures can impair plant metabolism, leading to reductions in root
    growth and decreased root water/nutrient uptake.
    <br> <br>
     4. Seed germination and
    root growth: Soil temperature is a critical environmental factor affecting
    the growth and development of roots. The optimal soil temperature for seed
    germination ranges between 68 and 86°F (20-30°C) . Root growth increases
    when the soil temperature reaches the optimal level, but declines when it
    exceeds the optimal level.
    <br> <br>
     5. Soil microbial activity: Soil moisture
    content affects the utilization of organic carbon and native soil organic
    matter by microbes. Low soil moisture content can lead to reduced metabolic
    activity and a limited rate of reproduction and respiration, while high soil
    moisture content can inhibit the activity of aerobic microbes and various
    oxidative enzymes[1]. In conclusion, tracking air and soil temperature and
    soil moisture is essential for predicting crop calendar schedules, as these
    factors significantly impact crop growth and development through their
    effects on plant physiology, water and nutrient absorption, photosynthesis
    and respiration, seed germination and root growth, and soil microbial
    activity. By monitoring these variables, farmers can make informed decisions
    about planting, irrigation, and harvesting schedules, optimizing crop growth
    conditions and minimizing the risk of damage due to adverse environmental
    conditions.
