    Weather factors, including humidity, temperature, solar radiation, and
    precipitation, are crucial for crop scheduling due to their direct and
    indirect effects on crop growth, development, and yield. These factors
    influence various aspects of plant physiology, such as photosynthesis,
    respiration, germination, and flowering.
    <br />
    <br /> <b>1. Temperature:</b> Temperature affects plant growth by influencing metabolic
    processes, such as photosynthesis and respiration. High temperatures can accelerate
    crop growth, leading to earlier maturity, while low temperatures can delay growth
    and development. Extreme temperatures can also negatively impact crop yield and
    quality. For example, high temperatures can cause dehydration and leaf scorching,
    while low temperatures can lead to frost damage and reduced germination rates.
    <br />
    <br /><b>2. Humidity:</b> Humidity affects crop growth by influencing the rate of
    water loss from plants through transpiration. High humidity can increase the
    rate of transpiration, leading to water stress and reduced crop growth.
    Conversely, low humidity can reduce the rate of transpiration, leading to
    reduced water use efficiency and reduced crop growth.
    <br />
    <br /><b>3. Solar radiation:</b> Solar radiation is essential for plant growth, as
    it provides the energy source for photosynthesis. The amount of solar
    radiation reaching a crop is affected by the amount of water vapor in the
    atmosphere, with clouds reducing solar radiation by reflecting it back into
    outer space. The ability of a crop to collect sunlight is a function of leaf
    surface area or leaf area index. 
    <br> <br /><b>4. Precipitation: </b>Precipitation affects
    crop growth by providing water for plant growth. However, excessive
    precipitation can lead to waterlogging, which can reduce crop growth and
    yield. Conversely, insufficient precipitation can lead to water stress,
    reducing crop growth and yield.
